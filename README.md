- 👋 Hi, I’m @Alwist31
- 👀 Im interested in microcontrollers. The missus wants a dynamic led lighting system for the house for Christmas that she can control from her phone. Why is beyond me, but i thought that a pico w, maybe a relay and a power supply might do the business. We'll see.
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning  C(++) after a 25 year absence. into micropython, prefer low level languages, assembly language, even poking in hex. Learned to code on a Z80.(that's how old i am!). Developed a procurement database for a shipping company entirely in VBA on Msaccess.(that's how old I am)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on model railways, sound fx for guitars, lighting fx for bands
- 📫 How to reach me alex.steinberg@sky.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Alex, old git.
